  # Hole 1: Multiply the contents of an array
  #
  # A nice each one to start. Given an array numbers, return the result of
  # multiplying all of the numbers together.
  #
  # The parameter `a` is the array of numbers.
  def hole1(a)

    # put your implementation in here, but please leave the comments above and at the 'end'

  end # Hole 1

  # Hole 2: Fizzbuzz
  #
  # Everyone knows fizzbuzz, right?
  #
  # The parameter 'l' is the limit - the highest number to reach.
  def hole2(l)

    # put your implementation in here, but please leave the comments above and at the 'end'

  end # Hole 2

  # Hole 3: The Caeser Cipher
  #
  # A very simple way of encoding one string, using a variable number of "shifts" to
  # turn each letter into a different one. If you know the shift, you can then decode
  # the string you receive into the original message. For example:
  #
  #  * "abc" with a shift of 1 becomes "bcd"
  #  * "Kello" with a shift of 3 becomes "Khoor"
  #  * "Jazz Hands" with a shift of 10 becomes "Mdcc Kdqgv"
  #
  # Your solution should handle upper and lowercase letters, retaining their case.
  #
  # The parameter `s` is the string to encode, and `x` is the number to shift by.
  def hole3(s, x)

    # put your implementation in here, but please leave the comments above and at the 'end'

  end # Hole 3

  # Please ignore this little bit of code plumbing
